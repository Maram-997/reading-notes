Readings - 04 : Data Modeling
## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development:
1. reduces the number of bugs in production and improves code quality.
2. create well-written unit of code (function, class, or module) that correctly performs a set of operations.
3. With TDD you will get a reliable solution.

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
Often while writing tests you have some setup work that needs to happen before tests run, and you have some finishing work that needs to happen after tests run. Jest provides helper functions to handle this.

## What is one downside of Test Driven Development
- Tests help to seek out bugs, but they can not find bugs that you simply introduce within the test code and in implementation code. 
- You’ll get the sensation that you simply need an extended duration of your time for straightforward implementations. 
- Probably, the strongest argument against TDD is that the tests need to be maintained because the code has got to. Whenever requirements change, you would like to vary the code and tests. But you’re working with TDD. this suggests that you simply got to change the tests first then make the tests pass.

## What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
- ES6 class constructor : 
This can be said to be a syntax base for constructor functions and instantiate objects using a new operator.	
- Constructor/Prototype Classes:
This also uses a new operator for object creation but focuses on how the objects are being instantiated.

## Why REST?
- REST is meant to work over HTTP (actually HTTP was influenced by REST).
- REST Makes your Application More Scalable (No state, Faster Data Interchange Format)
- Easy to modify and it's also able to answer many clients who can ask for different data types (XML, JSON, and so on).
