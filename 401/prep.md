## How to Solve Programming Problems:
#### A simple set of steps you can use for any algorithm type programming problem:
1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.
#### Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive:
* “Most people have no clue what they are doing with their time but still complain that they don’t have enough.” 
* “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”
#### How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving 
**Why is this important?**
* How you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):

1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.
>  sometimes you luck out. But that is the worst way to solve problems! And it’s a huge, huge waste of time.
> The best way involves a) having a framework and b) practicing it.

###### So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?
1. Understand :
How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.
2. Plan : 
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!
3. Divide : 
Do not try to solve one big problem. 
Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. 
4. Stuck? 
Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging.
#### 5 Whys (Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly)
> The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.
**When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis**
You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.
**How to Use the 5 Whys**
1. Assemble a Team
Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.
2. Define the Problem
If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example, "Team A isn't meeting its response time targets" or "Software release B resulted in too many rollback failures."
3. Ask the First "Why?"
Ask your team why the problem is occurring. (For example, "Why isn't Team A meeting its response time targets?")
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.
5. Know When to Stop
You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident.
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.
7. Monitor Your Measures
Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.
