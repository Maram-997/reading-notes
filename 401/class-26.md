# Read: Class 26 - Component Based UI

## Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

1. Vue.js
2. Angular
3. Meteor
4. Mithril js
5. Backbone.js

## Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?

* framework: controls the work flow
* library: you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library.

## JSX

`const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;`
It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
