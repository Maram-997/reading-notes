# Read : Class 09 - FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

## **Functional Programming** 
a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable.

## **Pure Function**

It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects
What are the benefits of a pure function? The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything.

## **Immutability** 

Unchanging over time or unable to be changed. When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.


## **Referential transparency** 

pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
