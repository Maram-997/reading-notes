# Read : Class 11 -  Mongo and Mongoose

## Five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

1. SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
2. SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
3. SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
4. For properties: SQL databases emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )
5. For DB types: On a high-level, we can classify SQL databases as either open-source or close-sourced from commercial vendors. NoSQL databases can be classified on the basis of way of storing data as graph databases, key-value store databases, document store databases, column store database and XML databases.

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
For the type of data to be stored: SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. 

## A real world example(SQL):
 MySQL Community Edition
##### MySQL benefits and strengths:
1. Replication
2. Sharding
3. Memcached as a NoSQL API to MySQL
4. Maturity 
5. Wide range of Platforms and Languages
6. Cost effectiveness

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set. 

## A real world example(NoSQL):
MongoDB

####  MongoDB benefits and strengths:
1. Speed
2. Scalability
3. Manageable
4. Dynamic Schema

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical 

## Which type of database is best for scalability?
NoSQL

## SQL stand for:
Structured Query Language
