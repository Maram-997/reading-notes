# Read: 03 - HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

### Lists : 
* There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.
* Ordered lists use numbers.
* Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.

### Boxes :
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
* You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
* It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

### Basic JavaScript Instructions :
* Statements : A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.
* Comments : You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.
* Variables : A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
 > How to declare a variable and assign value for them: 
 We need to announce that we want to use it. This means creating the variable and giving it a name. This called *Declarining a Variable* . After that we can tell it information we would like to store in it. This Called * Assigning a Value to a Variable* .
* DataTypes : JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.

 
#### Switch Statement :
Stats with a variable callrd the switch value. each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
>  The difference between If-else and Switch :
  **If - else:**
  *1.* There is no need to provide an option.
  *2.* With a Series of if statement, they are all check even if a match has been found.
**Switch:** 
*1.* you have a default option that is run if none of the cases matches.
*2.* if a match is found, that code is run; then the break statement stops the rest.
