#### Aligning images Using CSS
Web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images.There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:
1. The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.
2. New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page.
#### Centering images using CSS
By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text.In order to center an image, it should be turned into a block-level element using the display property with a value of block. 
Once it has been made into a block-level element, there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:
1. On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
2. On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.
