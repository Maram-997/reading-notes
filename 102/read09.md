### What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.

### What features should you look for in a text editor?
- Code Completion.
allows you to start typing,and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed.Also, some code completion includes the closing of tags when you open them,or the brackets, or the quotation marks.Another nice feature is being able to write your HTML and CSS more efficiently.
>There is a kind of shorthand language called Emmet that can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.

-  Syntax Highlighting.
is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.

- A Nice Variety Of Themes.
These themes will allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text, and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing software as well.
>So it’s good to find a theme that might reduce eye strain and fatigue.

- Extensions.
They are like plugins for your text editor, that allow you to have superpowers that you wouldn’t have otherwise. A text editor that has a great selection of extension will ensure that you have the ability to add functionality as you need it.

### Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer : 
Every computer will come with its own text editor.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.”

If you want to try using the text editors that come with your computer, there’s a couple of caveats that I’d like to make you aware of:
1. that you’re creating code in a plain text editor.
2. that you first create a folder on your computer somewhere to store your entire website, make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names.

### Third-Party Options :
Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded and installed to your computer from their respective websites. Each of these titles do have some if not all of the features that we talked about earlier.

### The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs :
A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text. It also manages text, and manages files.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
